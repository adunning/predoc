  abstract: Despite the lack of unanimity among European nations on how to treat so-called
    scientific and critical editions, most of these nations agree on the major proposition
    that this kind of work should attract some kind of protection under neighbouring
    rights doctrines in their copyright codes. Canada has no such provisions. This
    article explores the neighbouring rights protection in some European nations and
    shows that Canadian publishers of such editions should be aware of the diverse
    range of protection that they are given in Europe and the potential liability
    of Canadian publishers.En dépit de l’absence d’unanimité au sein des nations européennes
    quant à la façon de traiter les soi-disant “éditions scientifiques et critiques”,
    la majorité de ces nations s’entendent sur la proposition principale voulant que
    ce type de travail mérite de faire l’objet d’une certaine forme de protection
    en vertu des doctrines des droits voisins contenues dans leurs codes sur le droit
    d’auteur. Le Canada ne possède pas de telles dispositions. Cet article explore
    la protection qu’accordent les droits voisins de certaines nations européennes
    et démontre que les éditeurs canadiens de ce type de publication devraient connaître
    les différents types de protection dont ils bénéficient en Europe ainsi que des
    obligations potentielles que les éditeurs doivent remplir.

  title: All texts are equal, but… Textual plurality and the critical text in digital
    scholarly editions
  container-title: Variants
  page: 77-92
  volume: 10
  source: kups.ub.uni-koeln.de
  abstract: 'Is there a future for the “old philology”? Why are “truly critical”
    and “truly digital” editions so rare? This article discusses the questions raised
    at the Leuven round table by showcasing two scholarly editions that claim to be
    both digital and critical: the edition of William of Auxerre’s Summa de officiis
    ecclesiasticis, an early thirteenth century Latin treatise on liturgy, and the
    so-called HyperStack edition of Saint Patrick’s Confessio, a fifth-century open
    letter by Ireland’s patron saint, also written in Latin and the oldest text that
    has survived from Ireland in any language. In giving a comparative introduction
    to both of these online editions — to their underlying methodology and theoretical
    implications — I will make the following arguments: (1) Critical texts matter.
    The critical reconstruction of an assumed original text version as intended by
    an author remains of major interest for most textual scholars and historians as
    well as any person with an interest in historical texts. (2) Critical texts have
    the same legitimacy as various and different manifestations of a text. Digital
    editions enable the presentation of textual plurality. (3) There is no reason
    intrinsic to the digital medium that makes the idea of a critical text obsolete.
    Rather, a critical text can serve as the standard reference, as an ideal text
    to start with and as a portal to access the variety of textual manifestations
    of a particular work.'

  container-title: Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative
  volume: 7
  source: jtei.revues.org
  abstract: 'Recent proposals for creating digital scholarly editions (DSEs) through
    the crowdsourcing of transcriptions and collaborative scholarship, for the establishment
    of national repositories of digital humanities data, and for the referencing,
    sharing, and storage of DSEs, have underlined the need for greater data interoperability.
    The TEI Guidelines have tried to establish standards for encoding transcriptions
    since 1988. However, because the choice of tags is guided by human interpretation,
    TEI-XML encoded files are in general not interoperable. One way to fix this problem
    may be to break down the current all-in-one approach to encoding so that DSEs
    can be specified instead by a bundle of separate resources that together offer
    greater interoperability: plain text versions, markup, annotations, and metadata.
    This would facilitate not only the development of more general software for handling
    DSEs, but also enable existing programs that already handle these kinds of data
    to function more efficiently.'

  title: A critical edition of Alexander Neckam’s *Corrogationes noui Promethei* with
    introduction, textual notes, and commentary
  title-short: Corrogationes noui Promethei
  publisher: University of Toronto
  number-of-pages: 369
  source: ProQuest
  genre: PhD diss.
  abstract: The Corrogationes noui Promethei is a poem of 1630 lines written in elegiac
    couplets by the English author Alexander Neckam (1157-1217), an important figure
    in Anglo-Latin literature of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.
    Alexander was a prolific author with a wide range of interests. His works include
    treatises on grammar,natural science, biblical exegesis and theology, as well
    as a large number of sermons and a substantial body of poetry. The Corrogationes
    noui Promethei is a long moral poem on the vices written late in Alexander’s life
    with the apparent purpose of offering advice to abbots on the proper running of
    their communities. While selections from the poem have been published before,
    it has never been edited in its entirety and so has remained, along with the Suppletio
    defectuum, one of the last two major poetic works by Alexander still in manuscript.
    It is a work that contains much that is of interest and deserves an edition both
    in its own right and as a product of one of the more prominent Anglo-Latin authors
    of his time.

  abstract: Histories of magnetism and the mariner’s compass have usually been restricted
    to a few brief descriptions by Alexander Neckam, Guyot de Provins and Jacques
    de Vitry, followed by the important Epistola de Magnete of of Peter Peregrinus
    (1269). But by reviewing the many other early European references to the mariner’s
    compass, we find that there is little in Peregrinus that originating, knowledge
    of the compass.

  title: The identification of text variants by computer
  container-title: Information Storage and Retrieval
  container-title-short: Information Storage and Retrieval
  page: 89-108
  volume: 5
  issue: 3
  source: ScienceDirect
  abstract: This paper is an exhaustive description of a working program for collating
    texts. The procedure identifies text variants ranging from minute differences
    in punctuation and spelling to additions and deletions of larger portions of text.
    The aim of the procedure is to bring lineation of all texts to be compared into
    conformity with that of the base-text and to print out all variants in the texts
    beneath the base-text. The program accepts input in running text form from magnetic
    tape and does not require any editing or reorganizing of data prior to processing.
    Comparisons are carried out on a line for line basis, and searches for new correspondences
    when the texts are out of phase extend over an interval of twenty lines each side
    of the current line. The report also contains flowcharts and complete program
    listings, and fills a definite need in the area of variant identification since
    no other program written in a higher level language has so far been made public.
    Originally written in FORTRAN 32 for the CDC 3000 series computers, the program
    is so designed as to make the conversion to another machine a realistic enterprise.
    Both the problem of operation of the system and possible adaptation to other machines
    is discussed from the viewpoint of the user, and some suggestions for further
    development are offered.

  abstract: 'Publishing the diplomatic edition of a document on the web instead
    of in print implies a series of methodological and practical changes in the nature
    of the published text and in the operations to be performed by the editors. For
    print the choice of which features to include in the transcription is limited
    largely by the limits of the publishing technology. In contrast, the digital medium
    has proved to be much more permissive and so editors need new scholarly guidelines
    to establish ‘where to stop’. This article discusses a list of criteria and parameters
    for choosing which features to include in transcriptions. It also sketches the
    theoretical implications which result from the change of medium and technology.
    It is argued that the very definition of ‘diplomatic edition’ needs to be substantially
    revised if the edition is published on the web. Even more importantly, the discussion
    argues for the existence of a new editorial object which is generated by the changed
    conditions: a new publication form called the ‘digital documentary edition’ which
    is composed of the source, the outputs and the tools able to produce and display
    them.'
